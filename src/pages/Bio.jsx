              I’m a curious and collaborative front-end web developer with a passion for solving
              challenges and continuously learning. Whether it’s tackling a tricky bug or
              transforming a client’s vision into reality, I thrive on figuring things out and
              delivering impactful results.
            </p>
            <p className="body-text">
              With experience managing people and working in customer-focused roles, I’ve developed
              a people-first mindset. I listen carefully to clients, understand their goals, and
              create products that not only meet their expectations but often exceed them by
              uncovering deeper needs. This purpose-driven, collaborative approach keeps me
              energized and motivated in my work.
            </p>

              I’m currently seeking a front-end role where I can continue learning, bring creativity
              to projects, and contribute to a team’s success. I take pride in fostering a positive,
              uplifting environment, helping those around me grow, and ensuring the best outcomes
              for the entire team.
